<strong>1: I've been told that Instructors have different grades. What grade are you?</strong><br/>

I'm very proud to say that I'm a 'Grade 5' Driving Instructor. 'Grade 5' is one
of the highest possible grade that an Instructor can attain from the Driving
Standards Agency.<br/><br/>

<strong>2: Are you a fully qualified Driving Instructor?</strong><br/>

Yes, I have been a fully qualified, Government Approved Driving Instructor
for more than 20 years and I display a green octagonal badge showing my
registration details and ID. Beware though, because some larger Driving
Schools including BSM and Red use PDI's (Potential Driving Instructors).
Although these are registered Instructors, they are basically Trainees who
have not yet passed the final part of the stringent Driving Instructor test. You
can tell that they are Trainees because they must display a pink triangular
badge stating 'Trainee Instructor'<br/><br/>

<strong>3: What type of car will I be driving?</strong><br/>

You will be driving a new Toyota Auris There's a photo of my car behind the
Gallery button. We normally use new cars that are no more than 3 years old.<br/><br/>

<strong>4: How old must I be before learning to drive?</strong><br/>

The minimum age for a UK Provisional Licence is 17. You must be in receipt
of your Provisional Licence before you will be allowed to drive on a public
road! You can apply for a Provisional Licence up to 3 months before your 17th
birthday. If you are receiving Disability Living Allowance at the higher rate, you
can apply for a Provisional Licence as soon as you are 16 years old.<br/><br/>

<strong>5: How long will my lessons be?</strong><br/>

Generally, your lessons will last 2hours. It really depends on both your
availability and my availability.<br/><br/>

<strong>6: What will I do on my first lesson?</strong><br/>

It depends on what experience you already have. If you are a complete
beginner the first lesson will include all the safety aspects, an eyesight check
(you must be able to read a standard number plate from a distance of 20.5
metres)and we will run through the vehicle controls so that you know where
they are, what they do and when you need to use them. By the end of the first
lesson you will be moving the vehicle off from the roadside and stopping it in a
safe, legal and convenient place. Don't worry though, the first few lessons are
normally conducted in a very quiet road<br/><br/>

<strong>7: Do I need to pass my theory test before starting to drive?</strong><br/>

No you don't but it's a good idea to start your theory studies as soon as
possible because it will help your general understanding whilst driving.<br/><br/>

<strong>8: How many lessons will I need to pass my test?</strong><br/>

There's no definite answer to that question! It will largely be dependent on
your own aptitude and personal rate of learning ability. This is where taking
professional training from a DSA (Driving Standards Agency) Approved
Driving Instructor is the best course of action, particularly if you have little or
no previous experience of driving. The DSA do publish average figures which
can be found on the Government website: www.direct.gov.uk<br/><br/>

<strong>9: What is your pass rate?</strong><br/>

My current pass rate to 31st March 2013 is 100% This is based on results
from the last 10 driving tests. The National Average pass rate is only 46%!<br/><br/>

<strong>10: How will I know when I'm ready to take the practical test?</strong><br/>

We will continually monitor your progress and carry-out at least one mock test
to determine whether or not you are actually ready to take your practical test.
The final decision will be by mutual agreement.<br/><br/>

<strong>11: Where will you pick me up and drop me off?</strong><br/>

From anywhere within reason! I won't restrict you to being picked up and
dropped off at your home address. However, I will automatically assume your
home address unless previously arranged.<br/><br/>

<strong>12: Can I have my lesson at the same time every week?</strong><br/>

Yes, that actually makes it easier for me to plan my week<br/><br/>

<strong>13: Will you answer your mobile phone during my lessons?</strong><br/>

No, you are paying for my time and you will get 100% of my attention during
that time. (Emergencies would be the only possible exception)<br/><br/>

<strong>14: Will I be driving most of the time?</strong><br/>

Yes! I will sometimes carry out a short recap or subject briefing before you
initially drive off. After that, I will try to keep you on the move for most of the
time to maximise your driving time<br/><br/>

<strong>15: Do you charge for cancellations?</strong><br/>

Yes, I do request 48 hours notice if you want to cancel a lesson! There are
exceptions (illness etc),<br/><br/>

<strong>16: When I pay for my test does that cover all the charges for your car?</strong><br/>

No, the driving test fee goes directly to the DSA. There is a seperate charge
of &pound;44 for hiring the car for your driving test. This charge includes picking you
up from home/school/workplace, 1/2 hours pre-test practise, the driving test
itself, debrief and dropping you back home/school/workplace.<br/><br/>

<strong>17: Do you have automatic cars?</strong><br/>

No, at the moment I only use a manual car.<br/><br/>

<strong>18: How can I book my first lesson?</strong><br/>

You can <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a> (Please leave a message if I'm unable to
answer)<br/><br/>

<strong>19:What are your hours of business?</strong><br/>

Mondays - 9am to 4pm<br/>
Tuesday - 9am to 4pm<br/>
Wednesdays - 9am to 4pm<br/>
Thursdays - 9am to 4pm<br/>
Fridays - 9am to 4pm<br/>
Saturdays - 9am to 4pm<br/>
Sundays - Closed!<br/><br/>

<strong>20: Will there ever be other learners in the car while I'm having my
lesson?</strong><br/>

Absolutely not! I do not pick-up or drop-off other learners (known as 'piggy
backing') in your time. Your lessons will always be conducted on a one to one
basis.
