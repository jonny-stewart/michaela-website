    <p>Hello and welcome to my driving school. My name is Michaela and I have been a driving instructor for over 20 years. I originally trained with BSM in Maidstone and so I have years of experience in training all types of clients, from the 17 year old right through to the more mature who just need some help dealing with the ever changing demands involved on todays very busy roads.</p>



<p class="callToAction">Call 07885 701918 to book your lessons</p>

<p>I am patient and understanding with a real passion for seeing my clients progress swiftly and safely from the first driving lesson to successfully passing the practical driving test. My main priority is to make sure that not only are you ready to pass the driving test, but to ensure that you are ready and have the experience, knowledge and ability to face life driving on the open road.</p>



<p>I can give you driving lessons in Maidstone, Tonbridge, Paddock Wood, East Peckham, and the surrounding areas. A complete list of areas where I can teach how to learn to drive can be found here.</p>

<p>My tuition vehicle is a 2011 Toyota Auris 1.3 VVTI which is both practical to teach in and easy to drive. It has a 6 speed manual gearbox and has all the latest technology. It comes with ABS, power steering and even dual zone climate control! These all help to make it a very comfortable and practical environment in which to learn to drive in.</p>

<p>I am available to 6 days a week and can offer single or 2 hour driving lessons, intensive courses and dual carriageway experience. Theory test advice is also available throughout your training. Once you have passed the practical test I am more than happy to offer motorway lessons as the first time on a busy motorway can be very daunting, especially if it involves the M25!</p>

<p>You are my main priority and so I am very happy to tailor a course around your needs, with hours to suit and pick up from home, school or your work place. </p>
